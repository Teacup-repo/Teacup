# ðŸ“§ Email DLP Lab with Docker + Postfix

This project demonstrates a simple but effective **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** lab using Docker and Postfix. It simulates an email server that filters outbound emails for sensitive data such as **SSNs**, **credit card numbers**, and **keywords** â€” alerting when violations are detected.

Built entirely in a containerized environment for safe experimentation and reproducibility.

- âœ… Scans content for:
  - Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
  - Credit card numbers (Visa, MasterCard)
