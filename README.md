## 🚀 Featured Projects

| **Project** | **Description** | **Tools Used** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 🧅 **Security Onion Lab** | Built and configured Security Onion in a virtual environment. Imported and analyzed PCAP traffic to detect threats, investigate anomalies (e.g., WPAD spoofing, deprecated TLS, unencrypted file transfers), and respond using NIST IR methods. | Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata, Kibana, Wireshark |
| ☁️ **Web Hosting on AWS S3** | Deployed and secured a static website using Amazon S3 with IAM policies and bucket permissions for secure access. | AWS S3, IAM, CloudTrail |
| 🛡️ **Azure Defender Lab** | Hands-on lab with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Enabled threat protection, identified insecure configurations, and mitigated vulnerabilities in Azure VMs. | Azure Security Center, Defender for Cloud |
| 🔒 **UFW Hardening Lab** | Hardened a Linux server using UFW. Configured firewall rules to block unauthorized access while allowing essential services. | Ubuntu, UFW, SSH |
| 🔁 **SOC Automation with Shuffle SOAR** | Automated incident response workflows by integrating tools via Shuffle SOAR. Reduced time-to-response using rule-based playbooks. | Shuffle, Python, API Integration |
| 🧠 **MITRE ATT&CK Threat Modeling** | Used MITRE ATT&CK to map out threat behaviors and recommend security controls. | MITRE ATT&CK, Threat Intelligence |
| 🔐 **PCI DSS Assessment** | Conducted internal assessments to help organizations align with PCI DSS requirements. | PCI DSS, Risk Management |
| 📦 **Obfuscation & Code Security** | Obfuscated Python scripts using Pyminifier and Base64 to protect intellectual property. | Python, Pyminifier, Base64 |
