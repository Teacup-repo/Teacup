I'm a passionate Master’s student in **Cybersecurity**, bringing over **8 years of experience leading digital transformation** across academia, legal, and enterprise environments. With a strong foundation in secure systems, threat analysis, and compliance, I’m now pivoting fully into **network defense and information security** — combining hands-on technical skills with strategy-driven thinking.

I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously exploring new ways to **protect, detect, and respond** in digital environments.

## 🎯 Objective

After managing digital transformation and cybersecurity projects, I’m now transitioning full-time into cybersecurity—focusing on **network defense**, **incident response**, and **compliance**. My goal is to become a proactive and knowledgeable **Information Security Analyst**.
