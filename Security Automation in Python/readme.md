# üîê Suspicious Login Detector ‚Äî Security Automation in Python

This project is a simple but powerful Python-based security script I created to simulate a real-world detection tool. It reads system log files and looks for signs of suspicious login behavior, like brute-force attempts or logins that might indicate a compromised account.

The goal of this lab was to strengthen my Python scripting skills while applying core cybersecurity concepts like log analysis, incident detection, and alerting.

## üß† What the Script Does

When the script runs, it does the following:

1. Reads a system-style log file (`log_sample.txt.txt`) line by line
2. Tracks how many times each IP address has failed to log in
3. Flags IPs that trigger multiple failures (default: 3) as possible **brute-force attempts**
4. If a successful login follows failed attempts, it's flagged as a **possible compromised system**
5. Sends an email alert when suspicious activity is detected

This shows the detection engine in Python ‚Äî simple, readable, and powerful.

Here's the core of the script ‚Äî it reads the log, tracks IPs, and flags suspicious behavior:

This is what happens when an IP crosses the failed login threshold:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Screenshot: Possible Compromise Detected

A successful login **after multiple failures** is flagged as a potential account compromise:

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run It

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open it in Visual Studio, VS Code, or any Python IDE  
3. Make sure you have Python 3.8+  
4. Modify `log_sample.txt.txt` to test different login scenarios  
5. Run the script and view flagged IPs in your terminal

## ‚úâÔ∏è (Optional) Email Alerting ‚Äî Simulated Setup

I included optional logic to send email alerts for detected events. It's turned off by default, but here's what you'd configure if you wanted to use it:

```python
# Email Config
SENDER_EMAIL = 'your_email@gmail.com'
RECEIVER_EMAIL = 'your_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password'  # Use Gmail App Password (2FA enabled)
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
SMTP_PORT = 587
