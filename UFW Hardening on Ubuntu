# 🔐 UFW Hardening on Ubuntu

This project demonstrates how to secure a Linux system using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** by allowing trusted services, denying untrusted traffic, and validating firewall behavior through scanning with **Nmap from Kali Linux**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Environment

- 🐧 **Ubuntu 20.04 VM** (Firewall target)
- 💥 **Kali Linux VM** (Attacker/simulation for scanning)
- 🔥 **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- 🧪 **Nmap** (for port scanning and firewall validation)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

```bash
# Allow SSH from a specific IP (Kali VM)
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.105 to any port 22

# Deny all other inbound traffic
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw enable

# Add a custom deny rule
sudo ufw deny 50/tcp

# View active rules
sudo ufw status verbose

# Enable logging
sudo ufw logging on
