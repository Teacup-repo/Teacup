# UFW Hardening on Ubuntu

This project demonstrates basic host-based firewall hardening using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu. Includes steps to allow/deny traffic, validate with Nmap scans, and monitor firewall behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 VM
- **Testing tool:** Kali Linux VM (on same subnet)

## âœ… Tasks Completed

- Allowed and denied traffic from specific IPs (e.g., Kali VM)
- Configured default policies (`deny incoming`, `allow outgoing`)
- Enabled logging
- Verified behavior using Nmap scans
- Reviewed UFW status and rules with CLI commands

## ðŸ§ª Commands Used

```bash
# Allow SSH and specific IP
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.105 to any port 22

# Deny all other inbound traffic
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw enable

# List rules
sudo ufw status verbose

# Enable logging
sudo ufw logging on
