\# **Controls and Compliance Assessment Case Study** \#

**Overview**  
TechNest Innovations is a fictional startup based in the U.S. that specializes in developing smart home devices. With a growing online presence and an expanding customer base both domestically and internationally, TechNest is facing increasing pressure on its IT infrastructure to support its operations and ensure data security.

The IT manager has recognized the need for an internal IT audit to assess the current security posture and compliance with relevant regulations. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a comprehensive plan for business continuity and the potential risks associated with their expanding online operations. The manager aims to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with regulations related to online transactions and data protection, particularly in light of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European customers.

**Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report**

**Scope**  
The scope encompasses the entire security framework at TechNest Innovations, including all digital assets, internal processes, and compliance with best practices.

**Goals**  
The primary goal is to evaluate existing assets and complete a controls and compliance checklist to identify necessary improvements in TechNest's security posture.

**Current Assets**  
Assets managed by the IT Department include:  
\- On-premises servers and networking equipment  
\- Employee devices: desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones  
\- Smart home devices available for retail and online sales  
\- Management systems for inventory, customer relations, and e-commerce  
\- Internet access and internal network infrastructure  
\- Data storage solutions and backup systems  
\- Legacy systems requiring ongoing support

**Risk Assessment**

**Risk Description**  
TechNest Innovations currently lacks adequate asset management and does not have all necessary controls in place, which may lead to non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations.

**Control Best Practices**
The first function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) is to **Identify**. TechNest must allocate resources to identify and classify assets, assessing the impact of potential asset loss on business continuity.

**Risk Score**
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 7, indicating a significant level of risk due to insufficient controls and compliance measures.

**Additional Comments**  
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, as the IT department lacks visibility into which assets are most critical. The risk of fines from regulatory bodies is high due to inadequate compliance with data protection regulations.
