# 🌐 Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3

This project demonstrates how to host a simple static website using **Amazon S3**, with hands-on practice in cloud storage, access permissions, and public website hosting.

## 🛠 Tools & Services Used

- **Amazon S3** – for storing and serving website files
- **Static Website Hosting** – to make the site publicly accessible
- **ACL (Access Control List)** – for managing object-level permissions

## 🚀 What I Did

1. Created an **S3 bucket** in the N. California region
2. Uploaded `index.html` and a `.zip` file as website content
3. Enabled **Static Website Hosting** in S3 settings
4. Configured **ACLs** to make my objects public
5. Accessed my website via the **S3 bucket endpoint URL**

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Encountered a **403 Forbidden error** initially  
- Solved it by adjusting permissions to allow public read access to my objects

## 🎉 Outcome

Successfully launched my first website on AWS!  
This project took around **20 minutes**, and it was rewarding to see the site live online.
